<p>Onam (IPA: [oːɳɐm]) is an annual Indian harvest and cultural festival related to Hinduism celebrated mostly by the people of Kerala.[4][5] A major annual event for Keralites, it is the official festival of the state[4][6] and includes a spectrum of cultural events.[7][8][4][9]

Onam commemorates King Mahabali and Vamana.[10][11] According to Hindu legends, Onam is celebrated in Kerala in remembrance of the good governance under the rule of daitya king Mahabali, a mythical king. The legend holds that jealous of Mahabali's popularity and his power, the devas conspired to end his reign. They sent Vamana to earth in the form of a dwarf Brahmin who trampled Mahabali to patala (underworld). Vamana asked Mahabali for three feet of land as his wish from the generous Mahabali. After measuring the entirety of universe, leaving nowhere to place his third foot, Mahabali offered his own head to place his third feet, making the wish complete. However, witnessing Mahabali’s generosity, Vamana granted the king's sole wish to visit his land and subjects once every year. This homecoming of Mahabali is celebrated as Onam in Kerala every year[12][11]

The date of Onam celebration is based on the Panchangam, and falls on the 22nd nakshatra Thiruvonam in the month Chingam of Malayalam calendar, which in Gregorian calendar falls between August–September.[13][4]

The festival probably has ancient origins and it became intricately linked with Hindu legends at some later date.[14]Literary and epigraphical evidence suggests that Onam has a long religious context and history in Kerala and neighboring parts of South India:[14]

The earliest known reference to the word Onam as a celebration is found in Maturaikkāñci – a Sangam era Tamil poem from 3rd century CE. It mentions a festival called Onam being celebrated in dedication to Maayon (Vishnu) in Madurai, when games and duels were held in temple premises, oblations were sent to the temples, people wore new clothes and feasted.</p>
